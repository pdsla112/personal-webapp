                    I love building gaming computers!
                    The idea of thinking through the compatibility of different components
                    of my PC, and imagining its final form, is exciting and nerdy.
                    Also, you can play the latest games on it without worrying too much
                    about storage/graphic issues.
                </p>
            </div>
