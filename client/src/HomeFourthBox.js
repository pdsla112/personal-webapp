                <h2>My Other Hobbies</h2>
                <h3>Building Gaming Computers</h3>
                <p>
                    I love building gaming computers!
                    The idea of thinking through the compatibility of different components
                    of my PC, and imagining its final form, is exciting and nerdy.
                    Also, you can play the latest games on it without worrying too much
                    about storage/graphic issues.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning About Human History</h3>
                <p>
                    I love watching documentaries and reading books about how
                    archaeology is being used to uncover secrets about the ancient
                    past. Learning more about older civilisations allows me to
                    time travel to that place, and immerse myself into their
                    culture and vibe. This is probably why I enjoy playing massive open world
                    games that are set in the past, like <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance</em>,
                    <em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em> and <em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em>.
                </p>
                <h3>Eating and Learning About Food</h3>
                <p>
                    I know that this might sound kind of obvious. I mean who doesn't like food?
                    But, I <em>REALLY</em> like food. At the end of a hard day, there is almost 
                    nothing quite like eating good food, and feeling its satisfying flavours and textures.
